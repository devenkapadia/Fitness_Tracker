A lot of workout apps just shows how one has to work out, but doesn't make sure if the user really did it. With mediapipe library and Opencv, I have developed virtual AI trainer which tracks shoulders, elbow, and wrist key points and calculates the angle to ensure the workout is indeed completed. Further to make sure the user did not fake the action, I have created a 2nd CNN classification model which grabs wrist ROI to classify if the user is holding the dumbbells or not. The counter is incremented only when there are dumbbells
